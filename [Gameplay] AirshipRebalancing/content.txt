This mod is Rebalancing the Airships for me. Especially the Helium Airships.
The loading speed of the helium Airships is tweaked to double the speed(5x) of the natural gas Airships(2.5x).
(Vanilla is 1.0x load speed)
For my savegame it takes *25 Seconds to load a Helium Airship with 400t
and *48 seconds to load a Natural Gas Airship with 400t on 3x Game speed. *round about
I also use an 100t per slot mod to reduce the amout of ships on my savegame.
